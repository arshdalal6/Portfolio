            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>I am a passionate student at the University of Connecticut working towards a major of computer science. I am open for oppurtunities and will do whatever it takes to become a valuable asset in any field.
               My expected graduation date is May 2027 which would make me a current sophmore. I am from Manchester CT and I have always had a passion for technology and it's potential to make a difference.
               This world is fast paced and always evolving, as a programmer it's my responsibility to keep up with the demands of current technology and become a significant figure in any company that selects me. I
               am I huge fan of Basketball (Go Huskys!) and Cricket. Computer Science can get very stressful and sometimes isolating, but its always important to have physical exersize and have a way to take a step back from life.

                As of now I work for the Convention Center in Hartford CT with ProPark. Which is home to the biggest events in all of CT. As an event Coordinator I am responsible for estimating the parking circumstance
                that are derived from the estimated customer count which is tracked in Microsoft Excel. We are also responsible for Keeping track of data like total customer count and revenue made. We use this data with
                our team to determine better ways to promote big events in the area. We are hosts for some of the biggest events in CT including The Flower Show, ConnectiCon, as well as Comedy shows and Concerts. These
                events can range from 15000-30000 people.

                The University of Connecticut includes a variety of courses which sets you up to get experience with coding languages and their practical uses in the real world. CSE 2050 was my introduction to
                data structures and algorithms in python which taught us different types of structures like linked-lists, hashmaps, priority queues, 2d graphs and more! These data structures are crucial for optimizing
                all kinds of operations. CSE 3100 was my introduction into the language C, we learned the basic syntax as well as programming data structures in C and using pointers and allocation to create fast and
                powerful programs. Over the summer I decided to participate in the META Front-end Developor Course which taught me the essentials of HTML/CSS/JS which enabled me to create some powerful programs. Currently,
                I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JS, Python, SQL and C (programming language).
